## Storyboard (Round 2)

<center>Experiment: Stirling Cycle</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

The second law of thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe as an isolated system will always increase over time. It says that the change in entropy in the universe can never be negative.

Entropy is a measure of the molecular disorder or the randomness of the system. The second law of thermodynamics implies that as time increases, this disorder increases.

This experiment depicts the second law of thermodynamics with the help of two subsystems consisting of balls to show that ΔS<sub>universe</sub>>=0.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:


  The experiment consists of two subsystems filled with red and blue balls that have a removable partition between them. All the buttons and parameters are present on the right side of the frame. The variable panel consists of radio buttons to choose the type of fluid for each of the two subsystems and sliders for the temperatures of the two subsystems.

  The setup consists of two rectangles with a shared side that behaves as a partition. Within the first rectangle that behaves as subsystem 1, there are blue moving balls. Within the second rectangle that behaves as subsystem 2, there are red moving balls. When the partition is removed, balls in both the systems mix.

  By changing the temperature of the fluids, the speed (and hence, the entropy) of the system changes. When the partition is removed, it shows that the entropy difference between the two subsystems is positive.


  **2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals**:

* Understand the second law of thermodynamics and its implications for the entropy of the universe.
* Visualize the change in the subsystems as the parameters are changed.
* Calculate ΔS<sub>universe</sub>.
* Infer the positive nature of the change in entropy from the calculations.




  **2.3 Set the pathway activities**:

1. The initial T1 is taken as 200℃.
2. The initial T2 is taken as 200℃.
3. The initial Fluid 1 is taken as water.
4. The initial Fluid 2 is taken as water.
5. T1 can be varied from 200℃ to 210℃ using a slider.
6. T2 can be varied from 200℃ to 210℃ using a slider.
7. Fluid 1 can be chosen as Water, Air or Butane using the radio buttons.
8. Fluid 2 can be chosen as Water, Air or Butane using the radio buttons.

**2.6 Conclusion**:

The time taken to perform the virtual experiment.

The approximate time taken to understand the third law of thermodynamics and the procedure of the experiment would be 5 mins. The time taken to perform the experiment and notice the changes in the subsystems by varying the parameters would be 5 mins. The time taken to calculate ΔS<sub>universe</sub> would be 5 mins. Therefore, the total time taken to perform the virtual experiment is 15 mins.
