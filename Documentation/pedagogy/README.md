#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce the theoretical concept, Experimental analysis

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>

The second law of thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe as an isolated system will always increase over time. It says that the change in entropy in the universe can never be negative.

Entropy is a measure of the molecular disorder or the randomness of the system. The second law of thermodynamics implies that as time increases, this disorder increases.

This experiment depicts the second law of thermodynamics with the help of two subsystems consisting of balls to show that ΔS<sub>universe</sub>>=0.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
The animation of two fluids within 2 subsystems separated by a partition is displayed on the canvas. Initially, the fluids in the 2 subsystems are taken to be water. Other fluids such as air or butane can be chosen using the radio buttons. The temperature in both the subsystems is taken to be 200℃ and can be varied from 200℃ to 210℃. The final fluid temperature once the partition is removed is directly proportional to the temperatures of the two subsystems. This can be used to calculate the entropy difference in the 2 subsystems as well as the change in entropy of the universe.
