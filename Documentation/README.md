<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This experiment depicts the second law of thermodynamics with the help of two subsystems consisting of spheres to show that Î”S<sub>universe</sub>>=0.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

The second law of thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe as an isolated system will always increase over time. It says that the change in entropy in the universe can never be negative.
<br><br>
Entropy is a measure of the molecular disorder or the randomness of the system. The second law of thermodynamics implies that as time increases, this disorder increases.
